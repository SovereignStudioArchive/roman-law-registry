# 🏛️ ROMAN LAW REGISTRY
### Office of the Praetor Peregrinus | Sovereign Studio Archive

> "Dura lex, sed lex." (The law is harsh, but it is the law.)

This repository serves as the **Permanent Digital Archive** for the Roman Law Registry. It is the centralized jurisdiction for the management of creative sovereignty, lore-integration, and diplomatic intelligence.

## 🕶️ THE NOIR MANDATE
The Registry is governed by a 35mm Noir aesthetic—high-contrast, institutional, and uncompromising. This archive ensures that all "Foreign Envoys" and "Delegates" (AI agents and human participants) operate under a unified legal framework.

## 📁 ARCHIVE CONTENTS
- `index.html`: The Live Portal of the Registry.
- `Intelligence Files`: Decentralized records of the Eastern Districts.
- `Cinematic Lore`: 35mm visual records of the Founding Era.

## ⚖️ JURISDICTION
